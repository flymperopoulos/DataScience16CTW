#### Assessment evidence and interpretation:
Points of assessment:

1. `/app` - Contains all code for the Node+React web app that uses the predictive pricing model created in our exploration as a backend API. We feel confident that we fully met our goal of connecting our ML knowledge to our web development knowledge
2. `/model/model_report.ipynb` - Contains final iteration of predictive model developed. There are several key components we'd like to highlight
  - Modular + reusable code design throughout the model development
  - Effective and extensive documentation on feature engineering and modeling decisions
  - Good documentation and comments 
  - Some background explanation on the dataset to bring readers up to speed

#### Changing the world: 
*Do you think your project has the potential to change the world?  If not, why?  If so, what are the next steps to make this happen?*

We believe our project as the *potential* to change the world, but we're not quite there yet (pretty far away from actually changing the world in reality).

With a cleaner/more understandable UI and more data, this type of predictive tool could be used to provide more transparency into the industry, empowering both customers and hosts to get the best experience possible. We recognize that this isn't the most noble/groundbreaking way of changing the world that would save lives, but it's something we believe could have a real use if further developed. Giving the ability to potential future hosts to explore the price variations and, potentially, even other features, across different neighbourhoods and cities, allows individuals to gain a better understanding of what their pricing strategy should be to be able to compete in the emerging market of Airbnb bookings.

Some of the first steps we would take are expanding the UI to include extra features like showing similar listings to give the user a better context for the space they're searching in. 


#### Learning goals: 
*Did you learn the things that you wanted in this project?  If not, why?  If so, why do you think you were successful?*

Absolutely. We were looking to combine knowledge from different domains into one superproject, and successfully did so. One of the most exciting components about this project for us wasn't necessarily the modeling, or the web app creation alone, but the combination of the two. This cross-domain fusion was great to work on, and we came away with a better understanding of how data science and machine learning can be applied in a real-world (perhaps even commercial) setting. Additionally, we gained a lot from creating a tangible tool that can be interacted with - this satisfied our desire to take a step beyond the model development + submission to kaggle workflow that can feel less rewarding sometimes.
