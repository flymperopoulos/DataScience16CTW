For the purpose of our exploration, we'll start off by using well-known US cities - Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington DC, and Seattle. For each listing, Airbnb provides a large amount of features - check [here](https://github.com/flymperopoulos/DataScience16CTW/blob/master/report/listings_features.md) to see them all listed out."

    "### Choosing Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've done a good amount of initial preprocessing on our data, let's move towards some predictive modeling. Our goal is to develop a model that will predict a price given listing parameters. We'll experiment with including different features, and see which combination fo features and models produces the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some initial research we've decided to start off by trying four different models - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear Lasso\n",
    "       The Lasso is a linear model that estimates sparse coefficients. It is useful in some contexts due to its tendency to prefer solutions with fewer parameter values, effectively reducing the number of variables upon which the given solution is dependent.\n",
    "       \n",
    "2. ElasticNet \n",
    "       ElasticNet is a linear regression model trained with L1 and L2 prior as regularizer. This combination allows for learning a sparse model where few of the weights are non-zero like Lasso, while still maintaining the regularization properties of Ridge.\n",
    "       \n",
    "3. Support Vector Regression\n",
    "       Support Vector Regression is an implementation of regression that uses the SVM approach. In this case, we'll be using the linear kernel.\n",
    "            \n",
    "4. Ridge Regression\n",
    "       Ridge regression addresses some of the problems of Ordinary Least Squares by imposing a penalty on the size of coefficients. The ridge coefficients minimize a penalized residual sum of squares.\n",
