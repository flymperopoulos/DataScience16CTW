### Todo
7. Encoding of **amenities**?
5. Think about **encoding of property type** - we think it's important, but it doesn't seem to be helping 
1. Explore **tuning of alpha** - gridsearchcv?
2. **Mean absolute deviation** - how to use with existing models?
8. Figure out if we want to do anything about the **mean vs. median** in model scoring - how do we actually make this happen? Did some research - not immediately clear how to fit models with different metrics
3. Finish **connection** between model and app
  - Mapping between inputs and encoded features
  - Make a form
  - POST request works 
  - Finalize the python shell business
  - Make the UI better
4. Are there any other **features**?
9. What are we actually **delivering?** **What's the output?**
1. Documentation (spend half an hour just on documentation)
