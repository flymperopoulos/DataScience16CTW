### Todo
- [ ] Encoding of **amenities**?
- [ ] Think about **encoding of property type** - we think it's important, but it doesn't seem to be helping 
- [ ] Explore **tuning of alpha** - gridsearchcv?
- [ ] **Mean absolute deviation** - how to use with existing models?
- [ ] Figure out if we want to do anything about the **mean vs. median** in model scoring - how do we actually make this happen? Did some research - not immediately clear how to fit models with different metrics
- [ ] Finish **connection** between model and app
  - [ ] Mapping between inputs and encoded features
  - [ ] Make a form
  - [ ] POST request works 
  - [ ] Finalize the python shell business
  - [ ] Make the UI better
- [ ] Are there any other **features**?
- [ ] What are we actually **delivering?** **What's the output?**
- [ ] Documentation (spend half an hour just on documentation)
